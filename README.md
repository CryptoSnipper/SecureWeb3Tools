Fire is a tool that makes Web3 simple, by showing you what happens at the smart contract level in a human-readable format.

At Fire, we believe everyone should know what they're agreeing to BEFORE they sign a smart contract - yet very few actually do. We’d never sign a contract in real life without understanding it first. Yet, so many users transfer hundreds of thousands of $$ without any idea of what they’re actually agreeing to.\

3. https://revoke.cash/

When using dapps like Uniswap or OpenSea you have to grant them permission to spend your tokens and NFTs. This is called a token approval. If you don't revoke these approvals, the dapp can spend your tokens forever. Take back control by revoking your approvals.
